  Most of the design of our project comes from three files: popup.html, popup.css, and popup.js. This html file
contains all of the html of the popup window, tagging all of the options in the various dropdown menus with
values that we can use in our JavaScript file. Popup.css is used to determine what the popup window will look
like that shows up when one clicks on our extension. It contains simple CSS that determines its dimensions
and background, as well as the dimensions of the "color pickers", which are the color option sliders used in
the extension for selecting the font color and background.
  We wanted to make the layout of the extension's popup window clear and accessible, so we have separated it
into three categories: font type, color scheme, and font size. The project is meant to help people with
dyslexia, so we made the text in our popup window appear in the dyslexie font, which is a font specifically
designed to improve reading for dyslexics and which we use as the primary option for font in the extension's
list of potential fonts to switch website's text to. The design for the layout of this popup window (other than
the dimensions, padding, and background which is in popup.css as already mentioned) is actually done in the html
file popup.html, because the layout we wanted only called for a selection of font and a particular order of
divs in the popup, which does not require a css file.
  The most interesting stuff in our project happens in the popup.js file. This is where the actual functionality
of most of the project comes from. We use popup.js to link the option values from the html file to the actual
web page that a user is on and trying to change, as well as where we link what we call the "color pickers",
which are sliders with a full spectrum of the colors and possible shades, which returns a hex value that we can
use
