ReVision
===========

This CS50 Final Project implements a Chrome extension that makes websites more readable for dyslexics.
It does so by changing the font to Dyslexie, font color, font size, and background color.  

Installation
===========
Simply download and install this extension like you would any other. It is available in the Chrome Extension Gallery.
