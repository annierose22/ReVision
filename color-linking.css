// how to make the preset parts- black font, white background, link together and appear together when one button is pressed
 (i.e. black and yellow, black and creme, and blue and white, the most successful in the study)



 // this goes in a different file i think 
  and then the option to completely custom with two color sliders, one for the background and
  one for the font so ppl get the exact combo that is helpful for them?
